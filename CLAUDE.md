# WaveKat Core — Project Instructions

Shared types for the WaveKat audio processing ecosystem. This crate is a leaf dependency used by `wavekat-vad`, `wavekat-turn`, `wavekat-voice`, and any future WaveKat crates.

## Purpose

Provide the common audio primitives so that all WaveKat crates speak the same language. Nothing more.

## What Belongs Here

- Types shared across **2 or more** WaveKat crates
- Audio frame representation (`AudioFrame`, `IntoSamples`)
- Common constants (sample rates, format standards)
- Shared error types (only when genuinely shared)

## What Does NOT Belong Here

- Backend implementations (VAD models, turn detectors, ASR engines)
- Processing logic (resampling, filtering, feature extraction)
- Feature flags that pull heavy dependencies (`ort`, `ndarray`, `rubato`)
- Anything specific to a single crate — if only one crate uses it, it stays there

## Design Principles

1. **Zero dependencies** — this crate must have no external dependencies. It is a leaf.
2. **Tiny surface area** — only add types when there is a concrete need from 2+ crates.
3. **Stable API** — downstream crates depend on this, so changes here ripple everywhere. Be conservative.
4. **No feature flags** — keep it simple. If something needs a flag, it probably belongs in a downstream crate.

## Audio Format Standard

The WaveKat ecosystem standardizes on:
- **16 kHz** sample rate (the universal standard for speech ML models)
- **Mono** (single channel)
- **f32 normalized `[-1.0, 1.0]`** as the internal representation

`AudioFrame` accepts both `&[i16]` and `&[f32]` input transparently. The conversion happens once at construction. Downstream crates receive `&[f32]` from `frame.samples()`.

## Error Handling

`CoreError` is the unified error type for all fallible operations in `wavekat-core`.

| Variant | Wraps | When |
|---|---|---|
| `Io(std::io::Error)` | I/O errors | File/stream failures |
| `Audio(String)` | Format/codec errors | WAV encoding/decoding issues |

- Manually implements `Display`, `Error`, and `From<std::io::Error>` — no `thiserror` dependency.
- `From<hound::Error>` is gated behind `#[cfg(feature = "wav")]`: I/O errors map to `Io`, everything else maps to `Audio(msg)`.
- Downstream crates can add `From<CoreError> for TheirError` to make `?` work naturally.

## Code Quality

- `cargo fmt --all --check` — no formatting issues
- `cargo build` — clean build
- `cargo test` — all tests pass
- `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings` — no warnings
- No `unwrap()` in library code
- Error types use manual `Display`/`Error` impls (no `thiserror` — keeps zero required deps)
- `///` doc comments on all public items

## Conventions

- Keep the main branch stable and buildable
- **PR titles must use conventional commit format, max 50 characters** — e.g. `feat: add AudioFrame type`, `fix: normalize edge case`
- **Always use squash merge** when merging feature branches into main
